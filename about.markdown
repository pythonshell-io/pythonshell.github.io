I have been in the tech sector for around 10+ years. Generally, I am interested in Security, Microsoft product stack (Azure) and data analytics. I use Python and PowerShell primarily to carry out my "coding" and started this blog as a place to store my code for others to see as I feel the uses are generally broadly applicable!
